      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="CodeImage" src="Images\web-development.png" alt="Web Development Image">
        <h3>Coding and Web Development:</h3>
        <p>Web Design and Development are some of my favorite things to do to fill the time.
          I have been designing with HTML/CSS/Javascript for about 3 months now, but have years of experience with HTML/CSS.
          I would love to see my work out there helping other companies grow and have the websites they deserve!
          As I develop my skills I hope to be able to work with great companies in designing the best websites!</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="Networking" src="Images\database.png" alt="Database Icon">
        <h3>Networking and Database Administration:</h3>
        <p>I currently hold a Network+ certification and have close to two years of experience working with network equipment.
          I have experience with Cisco Catalyst/Meraki equipment as well as Ubiquiti equipment.
          As for databases I have a good working knowledge of querying databases and have experience working with both SQL Server (2012/2016) as well as MySQL.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="CyberSecurity" src="Images\cyber-security.png" alt="Cyber Security Icon">
        <h3>Cyber Security:</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity was what got me to go back to school. I believe that everybody needs to understand at least the basic security fundamentals.
          No longer can we (the technology community) just assume that we are creating secure technologies, we have to KNOW we are.
           I am currently enrolled in my final semester at WGU where I am studying Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.</p>

        <img class="HelpDesk" src="Images\electrical-service.png" alt="Support Icon">
        <h3>Tier 1/2 Helpdesk Support:</h3>
        <p>I have several years of experience working as both a tier 1 and a tier 2 helpdesk support engineer.
          Providing excellent customer service to internal/external clients is a #1 priority for me and  I strive to ensure that everyone's issues get resolved and the client gets the care they deserve.
          I have many certifications that provide me with strong troubleshooting knowledge to take on any technology related task.</p>
